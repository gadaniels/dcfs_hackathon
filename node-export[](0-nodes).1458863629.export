It means that the investigator found evidence of abuse or neglect by the parent or guardian who was being investigated. If you are one of the parents or guardians, it means that you are going to be required to do many things in the next several months if you want to keep being the caregiver of the kids, keep the kids living with you, or get the kids back to living with you. It\u0027s important for you to know, these are requirements - if you don\u0027t do them, only do some, or stop part way, you are at risk of losing your parental rights and all possibility of your kids living with you.

However, it\u2019s also important for you to know that the stated goal of DCFS is to keep families together, or return them to one another if they\u2019re separated for a period of time. The only goal more important for them is keeping all kids safe - which in this case means the law\u2019s definition of safe, and it\u2019s the case worker, the supervisor, and maybe the judge, rather than you as the parent, who decide.\r\n\r\nLots of things are about to happen.
